This file uses (Static Shared Memory)SSM to implement simple linear regression. 

====
y = b0 + b1 * x; 

use reduction calculate: 
	- sum(xi * yi), sum(xi^2), sum(xi), sum(yi)

then calculate: 
	- mean(x), mean(y)

finally: 
	- b1 = {sum(xi * yi) - n*mean(x)*mean(y)}/{sum(xi^2) - n*mean(x)^2}
	- b0 = mean(y) - b1*mean(x)
